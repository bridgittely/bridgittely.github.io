        <h5><strong>Background</strong></h5>
        <p>For our <strong>senior capstone project</strong>, we worked with a sponsor from SAP over 
            the course of 5 months to create a free, open source <strong>transcription tool.</strong>
        </p>


        <h5><strong>Objective</strong></h5>
        <p>Create a <strong>web application</strong> that will allow interviewers to <strong>record 
            and transcribe voice recordings, add labels for easy analysis, and provide privacy</strong> 
            for certain phrases that are confidential.
        </p>
        

        <br><hr>
        <h4><strong>Research</strong></h4>


        <h5><strong>Competitive Analysis</strong></h5>
        <p>To begin our research, we compiled a competitive analysis to compare existing transcription 
            websites and see what features we can integrate into our web app. We looked extensively 
            into their strengths, weaknesses, and pricing.
        </p>

        <!-- Blue color: #397EE5 / 0052CC-->
        <!-- Light blue: #7AA8EC-->
    

        <h5><strong>User Interviews</strong></h5>
        <p>Once we completed the competitive analysis, we furthered our research by conducting user 
            interviews with <strong>4 PhD/graduate students.</strong> The goal of the interviews was 
            to understand the user's perspective and what their struggles are when using current 
            transcription sites. We aim to alleviate their pains of manually transcribing audio files 
            and editing the audio to censor sensitive information.
        </p>

        <p>We asked <strong>open-ended</strong> questions such as:
            <br><strong>·</strong><em> What are some voice transcription tools you have heard of?</em>
            <br><strong>·</strong><em> What are some situations where you would use a voice 
                transcription tool, what is your goal?</em>
            <br><strong>·</strong><em> What is your current challenge when transcrbing interviews (or 
                any other audio recording)?</em>
            <br><strong>·</strong><em> What benefits do you see with the use of a voice transcription 
                tool?</em>
            <br><strong>·</strong><em> What issues do you see in using a voice transcription tool?</em>
            <br><strong>·</strong><em> What features would you like it to improve upon?</em>
        </p>

        <p>These were our <strong>key findings</strong>: </p>

        </p>
        
        <p>Questions asked:
            <br>What are some voice transcription tools you have heard of?
            <br>Have you had any experience with any of the listed voice transcription tools or something similar? What was the experience like for you?
            <br>What are some situations where you would use a voice transcription tool, what is your goal?

            <br>What are your "wish-list" items if a new tool were to be made?
            <br>Based on your experience, what can you do really well with voice transcription tools at the moment?
            <br>What can you not do well?
            <br>In terms of privacy, what are some examples of information that you would typically want to leave out when transcribing an interview?
        </p>
        
        <p>Key Findings:
            <br><b>1. RELIABILITY</b>
            <br>Users have described their experience using voice transcription tools not entirely negative, 
            but could be better. They understand the challenges with technologies, but have found it to be 
            unreliable. Users have to go back and manually check the transcription, so would 
            prefer to be more accurate. (50-60% accuracy)
            <br><b>2. SPEED/TIME</b>
            <br>Users want to improve productivity and efficiency by having their transcripts readily 
            available. They want to save as much time as they can, especially when they are scheduled to do 
            a lot of interviews (50+). Waiting for their transcripts to be completed by AI or manually can 
            take too long, ranging from 2-3 hours to 2-4 days. 
            <br>Used for interviews, voice memo of answers, 
            after surgery couldnt type but needed to type, research (user experiments), analyze 
            conversations, meetings (record voice and take manual notes). 
            Know something is interesting is happening at a point, but when transcribing, going back and forth 
            is difficult. Typing, have to keep track. Need a way to mark on the audio file.
            <br><b>3. ACCURACY</b>
            <br>Sometimes users are unable to just use the transcription generated by third party softwares as 
            it is because it's not accurate. They often cannot understand what people are saying in the recording 
            (have to write "inaudible", but AI transcriber is not corrrect when transcribing 
            parts). Always have to go back and edit. They also don't identy speakers well. 
            <br><b>4. PAIN</b>
            <br>Using a transcription tool will save wrist pain and improve users' well beings. It will also 
            prevent users from feeling fatigue.
            <br>Meetings: a lot of knowledge just talked about, not many people take notes 
            <br><b>5. PRIVACY</b>
            <br>Users feel uncomfortable uploading data because they have no idea what is happening with their 
            information.

        <h5><strong>User Personas</strong></h5>
        <p>Based on the information gathered from our research, we illustrated the goals, motivations, 
            and frustrations of two ideal personas that would be utilizing our transcription tool.

        <h5><strong>Storyboard</strong></h5>
        <p>To visualize possible situations where a user would need to use a transcription tool, we 
            created two storyboards to play out two different scenarios.
        </p>

        <p><strong>1. User uploading audio file and being given transcription from audio file</strong></p>

        <h5><strong>Product Features</strong></h5>
        <p>With ideas and suggestions from our competitive analysis and user interviews, we curated a 
            list of possible product features prioritized by what is needed, nice to have, and can be 
            added later on.

        <h4><strong>Develop</strong></h4>


        <h5><strong>Wireframes</strong></h5>
        <p>Knowing which features we needed to implement, we created a rough sketch of what our web 
            application will look like and the necessary steps a user will go through while using 
            the transcription tool.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Goal: upload an audio file to a project</strong></p>
        <img src="UploadSketch.png" style="max-width:100%" alt="SAP">

        <p><strong>Goal: add a code and highlight certain information</strong></p>
        <img src="CodeSketch.png" style="max-width:100%" alt="SAP">


        <h5><strong>Low Fidelity Mockups</strong></h5>
        <p>Using the sketches above as a guide, we created low fidelity mockups of the product in 
            more detail at each step.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Adding a project</strong>
            <br>Before a user can upload an audio file, they must create a project. This project 
            will act as a folder to store all related files.
        </p>
        <img src="AddingProject.png" style="max-width:100%" alt="SAP">

        <p><strong>Uploading a file</strong>
            <br>When a user uploads a file, a progress bar will appear on the top left corner of 
            the screen. This will let the user know how much longer it will take, and when it is 
            complete. Once the upload is successful, the transcript will automatically show up 
            beneath the toolbar. The different speakers will be identified by numbers with the 
            timestamps at which they spoke at.
        </p>
        <img src="UploadFile.png" style="max-width:100%" alt="SAP">

        <p><strong>Adding codes, comments, and highlighting</strong>
            <br>Users can add codes similarly to how they add projects. Each code will have its own 
            color. They can then use the highlight tool to select corresponding information. 
            Additionally, users can add comments at specific time stamps and view them when they hover 
            over the line of text. Each section of the transcript will also have a marker where users 
            can check off what they have already gone through.
        </p>
        <img src="AddingCodes.png" style="max-width:100%" alt="SAP">

        <p><strong>Minimizing projects menu</strong>
            <br>If the user wants to have more space to read through their transcript, they can 
            minimize the side menu by pressing on the arrow at the top of the screen.
        </p>
        <img src="CloseProjects.png" style="max-width:100%" alt="SAP">


        <h5><strong>Usability Testing and Feedback</strong></h5>
        <p>Once we had our low fidelity mockups completed, we conducted usability testing with the 
            same 4 participants from our user interviews. Their task was to <strong>upload an audio 
            file, add codes, and highlight key phrases from the transcript.</strong> Despite the 
            positive feedback that we received, the users did have some suggestions on areas that we 
            can improve on.
        </p>
        <!--
        <img src="Feedback.png" style="max-width:100%" alt="SAP">
        -->
        <p><strong>Positive Feedback</strong>
            <br><strong>·</strong> Liked the labels
            <br><strong>·</strong> Adding/uploading a project is obvious, clear and understandable
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>Improvements</strong>
            <br><strong>·</strong> Add description page for what each file is 
            <br><strong>·</strong> Need clean screen for editing (move projects to separate page to 
            reduce clutter)
            <br><strong>·</strong> Snip tool should cut out portions and create new copy, don't want 
            to alter actual raw data
            <br><strong>·</strong> Ability to do multiple files at once
            <br><strong>·</strong> Need error messages/help if something goes wrong
            <br><strong>·</strong> Confused between code vs highlight 
            <br><strong>·</strong> Not sure what it means/what to do after creating the code label
            <br><strong>·</strong> Not being able to actually type (but this is just a prototype so 
            it's okay)
            <br><strong>·</strong> Thought had to click on project 1 to upload file (but prototype 
            automatically puts file into recently created project)
            <br><strong>·</strong> Arrows: if nothing within it, don’t point down as if it is 
            expanded, this was confusing
        </p>
        

        <h5><strong>High Fidelity Mockups</strong></h5>
        <p>Taking user feedback into consideration, we made the neccessary adjustments and improved 
            our final design. 
        </p>

        <p><strong>Projects Page</strong>
            <br>We moved the projects into their own separate page where users can add 
            descriptions and color code each folder. They can now upload multiple files into specific 
            projects, and once completed, will be listed underneath. 
        </p>

        <p><strong>Transcript Page</strong>
            <br>For the transcript page, we moved the toolbar from the top of the page to the side 
            for easier access. We also changed the appearance of the audio player and added a 10 
            second forward/backward option. Rather than having the user create a code, and then 
            selecting the hightlight option, we just have the user select the text they want to 
            highlight and add a code as one single step.
        </p>

        <h5><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></h5>
        <p>This project was an exciting and great learning experience for me since it was my first 
            time working on UI/UX for a product through its entire lifecycle.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Communication is key</strong>
            <br>About halfway into the project, the covid-19 lockdown occurred. Because of this, 
            everything was converted to a virtual workspace. Constant communication between the 
            team was very important because we went from meeting and working together in person
            every week, to strictly online only which caused some miscommunication and confusion 
            amongst the team and each person's tasks. To ensure that each team member knew what 
            they were doing and planning to do in the future, we scheduled daily check-ins on 
            slack and weekly zoom calls.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Validation of features</strong>
            <br>Clarifying the product details and specifying its requirements early in the 
            design process was important for us to be efficient as possible and make sure that 
            the product was correct. We had frequent check-ins with the sponsor about the 
            features we were implementing to confirm that they were still desired. 
        </p>

        <p><strong>Appreciating criticism</strong>
            <br>Asking for feedback from user testing, my peers, and my sponsor was crucial 
            for me to push my creativity and to design the UI as best I could for potential 
            users. Their critiques helped me see things that I was missing or had second-guessed 
            myself on. I realized that no design is perfect and that there is always room for 
            improvement. 
        </p>

        <p><strong><em>If we had more time... </em></strong>
            <br>As you can see from the video above, our final product looked a bit different 
            from our final mockup design. Because of the software we were using, we experienced 
            trouble adding in some features, such as the toolbar, which we made as a right-click 
            menu instead. Due to the time constraint, we didn't have enough time to clean up the 
            UI as much as we would have liked. The labels on the side for each highlighted text 
            weren't aligned on the side and we weren't able to add different color options for 
            them. However, we did the best we could as making sure that the transcript/audio 
            functions actually worked was the biggest priority.
