        <h6><strong>CHALLENGE</strong></h6>
        <p>Create a web application that will allow interviewers to record and transcribe voice recordings, add labels for easy analysis, and provide privacy for certain phrases that are confidential.</p>
        
        <h6><strong>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</strong></h6>
        <p>To begin our research, we compiled a competitive analysis to compare existing transcription websites and see what features we can integrate into our web app. We looked extensively into their strengths, weaknesses, and pricing.</p>

        <!-- Blue color: #397EE5 / 0052CC-->
        <!-- Light blue: #7AA8EC-->
    
        <h6><strong>USER INTERVIEWS</strong></h6>
        <p>In addition to the competitive analysis, we furthered our research by conducting user interviews to better understand who are users are.</p>
        <p>Target users:
            <br>- Graduate students: Transcribing research interviews 
            <br>- Employees: Transcribing meetings
            <br>Goal: Aim to alleviate the pain of manually transcribing audio files and editing the audio to censor sentitive information
        </p>
        <!--
        <p>Questions asked:
            <br>What are some voice transcription tools you have heard of?
            <br>Have you had any experience with any of the listed voice transcription tools or something similar? What was the experience like for you?
            <br>What are some situations where you would use a voice transcription tool, what is your goal?
            <br>What is your current challenge when transcrbing interviews (or any other audio recording)?
            <br>Are you confident in the results of voice transcription technology?
            <br>What benefits do you see with the use of a voice transcription tool?
            <br>What issues do you see in using a voice transcription tool?
            <br>When using a voice transcription tool, what features do you expect it to have readily available?
            <br>Furthermore, what features would you like it to improve upon?
            <br>What are your "wish-list" items if a new tool were to be made?
            <br>Based on your experience, what can you do really well with voice transcription tools at the moment?
            <br>What can you not do well?
            <br>In terms of privacy, what are some examples of information that you would typically want to leave out when transcribing an interview?
        </p>
        -->
        <p>Key Findings:
            <br><b>1. UNRELIABLE/RELIABILITY</b>
            <br>Users have described experience using voice transcription tools not entirely negative, but could be better. Unreliable--have to go back and manually check transcription, would prefer to be more accurate. Understand challenges with technologies. (50-60% accuracy)
            <br><b>2. SPEED/TIME</b>
            <br>Improving productivity and efficiency, readily available. Want to save time (if scheduled to do a lot of interviews (50+)). Used for interviews, voice memo of answers, after surgery couldnt type but needed to type, research (user experiments), analyze conversations, meetings (record voice and take manual notes)
            <br><b>3. ACCURACY</b>
            <br>Cannot understand what people are saying in the recording (have to write "inaudible", but AI transcriber is not corrrect when transcribing parts)
            <br><b>4. PAIN</b>
            <br>Saves wrist pain/well being
            <br>Meetings: a lot of knowledge just talked about, not many people take notes 
            <br><b>5. PRIVACY</b>
            <br>Issues: no idea what is happening with data (uncomfortable uploading data)
        </p>

        <p>Features:
            <br>tagging, putting markers, can go back ad replay, commands and graphical user interface, place visible markers along player, can do it multiple times(be able to play from marker), ability to insert time stamps, to do transcription as you are uploading the file-can listen and correct certain parts, flagging(tools can flag for you "I'm not sure about this part"), specify timestamp of speaker, distinguish different speakers, playback speed, add new speakers, search and replace
        </p>

        <h6><strong>USER PERSONAS</strong></h6>
        <p>Based on the information gathered from our research, we came up with two ideal personas that would be utilizing this transcription tool. Taking their goals, motivations, and frustrations, we used this as a guide in our design process to create a solution in the viewpoint of an ideal user.</p>

        <h6><strong>WIREFRAMES</strong></h6>
        <p>Goal: upload an audio file to a project</p>

        <p>Goal: add a code</p>

        <h6><strong>LOW FIDELITY MOCKUPS</strong></h6>
        <p>After sketching out a rough idea of our web aplication, I created low fidelity mockups of the product.</p>
        <p>Adding a project is clear and understandable
            Uploading is obvious
            Confused between code vs highlight
            Not sure what it means/what to do after creating the code label
            Most confusion revolved around what the software actually does but was still able to navigate through website
            Not being able to actually type (but this is just prototype so ok)
            
            Thought automatically uploaded audio file because the audio file was already under the project name even when the progress bar wasn’t completed
            Thought had to click on project 1 to upload file (but prototype automatically puts file into recently created project)
            Arrows: If nothing within it, don’t point down as if it is expanded, this was confusing
            Didn’t know what code meant 
            CAN CHANGE TO TAG
            Assume you drag code into whatever you want to label
