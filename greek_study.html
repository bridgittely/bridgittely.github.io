    <h6><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></h6>
    <p>Greek Study is a <strong>mobile application</strong> used by college Greek-letter 
      organizations to <strong>keep track of how many study hours each member has completed weekly.
      </strong> Users must be at designated areas on campus in order for their hours to be taken 
      accounted for. 
    </p>


    <h6><strong>OBJECTIVE</strong></h6>
    <p><strong>Redesign</strong> the interface of Greek Study to <strong>improve the overall user 
      experience</strong> of the current app.
    </p>


    <h6><strong>THE CURRENT DESIGN</strong></h6>
    <p>The screenshots below show how the application currently looks like.</p>

    <h6><strong>USER RESEARCH</strong></h6>
    <p>I wanted to get more insight on other people's experiences using the app. In addition to 
      reading over Greek Study's ratings and reviews in the app store, I reached out to 
      <strong>5 frequent</strong> and <strong>5 first-time users</strong> to see what issues 
      they encountered upon using the application. 
    </p>
    
    <p>These were the <strong>key pain points</strong> that I found: </p>
    <img src="PainPointsv3.png" style="max-width:100%" alt="Greek Study">
    <!--
    <br>1. Users have a hard time figuring out how many hours they have completed for each week.
    <br>2. Users find the multiple menus to be confusing and poorly designed; they want all 
      functions to be stored under one main menu.
    <br>3. Users prefer to have an actual start button to begin timing their study hours 
      because the plain text saying "Start Studying" makes it easy to forget to press record, 
      thus having them lose hours.
    </p>
    -->

    <h6><strong>USER PERSONA</strong></h6>
    <p>After gathering information from user research, I summarized my key findings into a target 
      user persona.
    </p>
    <img src="chart.png" style="max-width:100%" alt="Greek Study">


    <h6><strong>IDEATION</strong></h6>
    <p>From the feedback obtained through user research, I categorized possible solutions to tackle 
      each problem:
    </p>

    <p><u>Condense the study hours list</u>
      <br><strong>- Add total hour count feature for each week</strong>
      <br>Although there is a banner on the top of the home page that shows the user's study hours 
      for the week, this is the only place on the entire app that the user is given this information.
      It also only displays the hours for the current week. When looking at the Study Hours page, 
      it's just a long list of each individual study session recorded. There isn't a section or 
      option that shows the user how many hours they have completed for each specific week. To make 
      the study hours list less clustered and fix <strong>pain point 1</strong>, dividing each week 
      into its own section will make it more convienent for the user to find exactly how many hours 
      they have completed each week. 
    </p>

    <p><u>Reconstruct the home page</u>
      <br><strong>- Combine multiple menus into one</strong>
      <br>On the current design of the app, there are two "menus." One is located at the top left 
      corner of the screen. Additionally there is a taskbar with more features on the bottom 
      of the screen. To add organization and cover <strong>pain point 2</strong>, moving all 
      features under one menu would get rid of any confusion for the user. They can easily find 
      what they are looking for in one place.
      <br><strong>- Add logout button</strong>
      <br>Instead of having logout being an option from the menu, adding a logout icon on the 
      far right corner will allow faster and easier access for the user.
      <br><strong>- Have an actual start button</strong>
      <br>To resolve <strong>pain point 3</strong>, converting the "Start Studying" text to an 
      actual button will be a visual reminder to the user to press on it to begin recording their 
      time studying. The button will be green to attract their attention, and will turn red as the 
      timer begins. The red will indicate that once the user is finished with their work, they will 
      rememeber to press on it again to end and record their hours.
    </p>

    <p><em><u>Other improvements</u></em>
      <br><strong>- Add app name to login page</strong>
      <br>Since this is the first screen that users will see when they first open the app, the 
      name should be displayed to let them know what it is.
      <br><strong>- Sort locations list in alphabetical order</strong>
      <br>All of the locations are just listed randomly and not in any specific order. Sorting 
      the names will make them easier for the user to find what they are looking for.
      <br><strong>- Add search feature to locations list</strong>
      <br>If the user wanted to go to a specific location but wasn't sure if it would count 
      towards their study hours, adding a search for the locations list can them figure that out 
      quickly.
    </p>
    <!--
    <p><u>Fix the login page</u>
      <br><strong>- Recenter the elements on the login screen</strong>
      <br>The first thing that I noticed when looking at the login page was the awkward and uneven 
      spacing. Moving the logo and login information down towards the center will look more 
      appealing to new users. 
    </p>
    
    <p><u>Organize the locations list</u>
      <br><strong>- Sort the list by name</strong>
      <br>The original locations list had no organization or order to it. The names are just listed 
      in a random order. Changing to list the locations in alphabetical order will make them easier 
      for the user to find.
      <br><strong>- Add a search feature</strong>
      <br>Adding in a search function can help the user look up certain places to see if they are 
      designated study areas to ensure that their study hours will count.
    </p>
    -->

    <h6><strong>WIREFRAMES</strong></h6>
    <p>The new design for the user interface was based on possible solutions
        previously curated during ideation.
    </p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-sm">
        <img src="wf1.png" style="max-width:100%" alt="Login Page Wireframe">
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm">
        <img src="HomePageWF.png" style="max-width:100%" alt="Home Page Wireframe">
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm">
        <img src="MenuWF.png" style="max-width:100%" alt="Menu Page Wireframe">
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm">
        <img src="StudyListWF.png" style="max-width:100%" alt="Study List Page Wireframe">
      </div>
      <div class="col-sm">
        <img src="LocationsWF.png" style="max-width:100%" alt="Locations Page Wireframe">
      </div>
    </div>


    <h6><strong>USABILITY TESTING AND IMPROVEMENTS</strong></h6>
    <p>I reached out to the same users that I had done interviews with to ask them for their
      feedback on my new UI designs as they were given the task to <strong>login, find a valid 
      study location, begin timing their study session, and check their study hours.</strong> 
      Overall the responses were positive, but there were minor changes that came up.
    </p>

    <p><strong>1. The icons for the menu felt too big for the screen</strong> 
      <br>To fix this, I decided to reduce their size and also remove the labeling underneath since 
      I will be using common icons that are easily recognizable.
    </p>

    <p><strong>2. Study list is too long to scroll through</strong> 
      <br>Instead of displaying the user's study hours as one continuous list, I added 
      a dropdown for each week. This way, the user can easily find a specific week they're looking 
      for and find how many hours they've completed during that time.
    </p>


    <h6><strong>THE RESULT</strong></h6>

    <p>The screens display the final changes that I made to the interface.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
    -->
    <p><strong>Login</strong>
      <br>The awkward and uneven spacing was a major flaw in the original design of the login page. 
      I added the name of the app, which was initially missing, and moved the logo and login 
      information down towards the center to focus the user's attention and make the page more 
      appealing. 
    </p>
    <img src="LoginDesign.png" style="max-width:100%" alt="Login Final Design">

    <p><strong>Menu</strong>
      <br>Rather than having the map be a satellite view, I changed it to a basic standard map with 
      names being displayed at each location to make them easier to find. In addition to having a 
      singular menu, the current location and study time are grouped together at the bottom of the 
      screen above the start button. Users can choose to have this displayed on the screen, or they 
      can swipe it down to clear space.
    </p>
    <img src="MenuDesign.png" style="max-width:100%" alt="Menu Final Design">

    <p><strong>Study Hours List</strong>
      <br>The study hours are now organized by week. Users can easily find a specific week they 
      are looking for and click on the dropdown to see how many hours were completed. The 
      original way that hours were accounted for also didn't make much sense. It's hard to 
      calculate how much "1.7 hours" meant, so I changed them to display as "hours:minutes."
    </p>
    <img src="StudyHoursDesign.png" style="max-width:100%" alt="Study Hours Final Design">

    <p><strong>Locations List</strong>
      <br>The original locations list had no organization or order to it. The names were just 
      listed randomly, so I changed it to sort the locations alphabetically to make it easier for 
      the user to find a specific place. I also added in a search function to help the user look 
      up certain places to see if they count as designated study areas to ensure that their study 
      hours will count.
    </p>
    <img src="LocationsDesign.png" style="max-width:100%" alt="Locations Final Design">

    <p><strong>Timer</strong>
      <br>Making the timer bright red will acknowledge the user that time has started and remind 
      them to end their study session once they are done. They will simply press on the button to 
      record their hours, which will then turn back to green.
    </p>
    <img src="TimerDesign.png" style="max-width:100%" alt="Timer Final Design">


    <h6><strong>KEY TAKEAWAYS</strong></h6>
    <p>Working on this redesign project had taught me the importance of <strong>listening to the 
      needs of the user and understanding their concerns</strong> before beginning the design 
      process. I made sure to keep their insights in mind as I was making decisions on what needed 
      to change in order to enhance the user experience. Since this was an existing app, it 
      was a good challenge for me to improve my visual eye for design as I had to find ways to 
      upgrade the interface while maintaining the brand's prominent green color.
    </p>

    <p>The next steps for this project would be to gather more feedback as I continue iterations 
      to grow my design skills and constantly improve the overall experience for current and future 
      users.
